# ReviewBot

**ReviewBot** is an automated, multi-language code review system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and annotate source code files for best practices, maintainability, and potential issues. It supports batch reviews across multiple files and languages, making it ideal for modern, polyglot codebases.

## Features

- **Automated code review** for all major programming languages.
- **Batch processing:** Review multiple files at once, even across different languages.
- **LLM-powered analysis:** Uses Ollama by default; easily extendable to Gemini or OpenAI APIs.
- **Structured, actionable feedback** with severity ratings and recommendations.
- **Easy integration:** Just drop your files into the `tests/` folder and run.

## Running Tests

To run the code review on all files in the `tests/` folder (including subfolders like `tests/samples/`):

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_inline_engine.py
```

- The system will automatically detect and review all files, regardless of language.
- Annotated review reports are saved in `tests/samples/annotated/` (or similar output directories).

## Example Output

Below is a screenshot of a sample code review report generated by ReviewBot using the Ollama LLM backend:

- **Default:** Ollama (local LLM)
- **Optional:** Gemini and OpenAI APIs (API keys are set up in `config/secrets.env` and `auth/`, but may require small code changes if you want to switch back to these providers).

**Note:** If Gemini or OpenAI APIs are not working, the system will fall back to Ollama, ensuring uninterrupted reviews.

## Customization

- To add or modify review rules, edit the files in the `rules/` directory.
- To support additional LLMs, update the agent logic in `agents/llm_agent.py` and adjust the API keys in `config/secrets.env`.
